# Dynamic Quote Generator (ALX - DOM Manipulation)

## What this implements
- Advanced DOM manipulation (dynamic creation of form and quote cards)
- localStorage persistence for quotes and last selected filter
- sessionStorage usage for last viewed quote
- JSON export/import (file download + file input)
- Category-based filtering with categoryFilter
- Simulated server sync (JSONPlaceholder) with server-wins conflict resolution

## Files
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js

## How to run
1. Put files in dom-manipulation/ directory.
2. Open index.html in browser (no server required).
3. Use buttons to add, filter, export/import and sync.

## Notes
- Required global functions for ALX checker: showRandomQuote() and createAddQuoteForm() — both are exposed on window.
